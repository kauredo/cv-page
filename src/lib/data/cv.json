		"summary": "My journey in psychology began with a deep curiosity about how people think, feel, and grow. I am particularly drawn to working with students experiencing mood disorders, anxiety, and emerging personality disorders. My approach is grounded in cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), with a strong focus on helping young people develop insight and practical strategies to manage their thoughts, emotions, and behaviours. I am committed to continued growth in the field of youth mental health and to delivering evidence-based, compassionate support for children and adolescents.",
