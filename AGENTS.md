## Design Context

### Users
Portfolio visitors—primarily recruiters, hiring managers, and potential collaborators—who are evaluating a developer's skills and personality. They arrive with limited time and want to quickly assess competence, see real work, and get a sense of who they'd be working with. The site serves as a first impression before interviews or project discussions.

### Brand Personality
**Fun, Bold, Approachable**

The voice is confident but not arrogant—someone who takes their craft seriously while not taking themselves too seriously. The basketball motif and "making the web a little more fun" tagline reflect genuine enthusiasm. Design should feel human and personal, not templated or corporate.

### Aesthetic Direction

**Visual tone**: Clean minimalism with moments of personality. High design quality with intentional restraint—not flashy, but polished. Every element should feel considered.

**Theme**: Light and dark modes, both first-class citizens. The "vasco" blue palette (#59a7ff → #0f2e8a) provides identity without overwhelming.

**Typography**: Inter for readability, generous line-height, clear hierarchy.

**Motion**: Subtle, purposeful animations (fade, fly) that enhance rather than distract. Support prefers-reduced-motion.

**Anti-references**:
- Generic Tailwind/Bootstrap templates that blend into the crowd
- Stiff corporate sites that strip away personality
- Over-animated portfolios that prioritize wow over substance
- Boring or forgettable designs that don't reflect the "fun, bold" personality

**Direction**: Greater focus on distinctive design—elevate beyond clean-but-generic to something memorable. Bold doesn't mean loud; it means confident choices that create a unique impression.

### Design Principles

1. **Personality over perfection** — Let the human shine through. A small quirk that feels genuine beats a polished element that feels templated.

2. **Earned attention** — Every animation, color, or visual flourish should serve a purpose. Restraint makes bold moments land harder.

3. **Clarity first** — Users need to quickly find projects, experience, and contact info. Design should guide, not obstruct.

4. **Dark mode as equal** — Both themes deserve the same attention. Dark mode isn't an afterthought.

5. **Accessible by default** — WCAG AA contrast ratios, keyboard navigation, screen reader support. Good design works for everyone.
